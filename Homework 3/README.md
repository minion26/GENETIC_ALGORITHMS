 Solve one of the problems below with a Genetic Algorithm and another heuristic:  The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)(Test instances).
 Use only instances from instance libraries (don't generate your own test instances). Use at least 10 instances, with 3 of them the largest and most difficult available. Suggestion: 1 easy instance, then increase the size and difficulty until the 3 most difficult ones.
Penalty: 0.5 point each if you go over 2000 generations or 200 individuals after selection. (Try to work efficiently, and balance exploration and exploitation in the algorithm).

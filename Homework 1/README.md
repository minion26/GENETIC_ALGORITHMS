Find the minimum for the following functions: De Jong 1, Schwefel's, Rastrigin's, Michalewicz's 
using the Hill Climbing (the first improvement, best improvement and worst improvement variants) 
and Simulated Annealing algorithms (hybridising one of the Hill Climbing variants).
Analyse the 5-, 10- and 30-dimensional versions of all functions. 
(Perhaps run the 100-dimensional version as well, as an upper bound). 
Use a precision of at least 5 decimal places after 0.
